“It is a fact and the United States government maintains this fact that Iran has never been closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” Leavitt said when asked whether Trump is relying on US intelligence or intelligence sharing from an ally when he says Iran is very close to a nuclear weapon.

About the possibility of a deal with Iran, she said, "Iran is in a very weak and vulnerable position because of the strikes and the attacks from Israel... And he has been very direct and clear. Iran can and should make a deal. We sent a deal to them that was practical, that was realistic, or they will face grave consequences."

Replying a question about how close Iran is to potentially build a nuclear bomb, the spokeswoman said, "Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. All they need is a decision from the Supreme Leader to do that. And it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would, of course, pose an existential threat, not just to Israel, but to the United States and to the entire world."

- Summary

- G7 statement condemns Iran, supports Israel
- Iran-Israel war began on Friday when Israel struck Iran
- War has put oil-rich region on edge
- US says Trump still aiming for nuclear deal with Iran

WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven nations expressed support for [Israel](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/israel-iran-battle-escalates-will-be-high-agenda-world-leaders-meet-2025-06-16/) in a [statement, opens new tab](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2025/06/16/g7-leaders-statement-recent-developments-between-israel-and-iran) issued late on Monday and labeled its rival [Iran](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-urges-tehran-evacuation-iran-israel-conflict-enters-fifth-day-2025-06-17/) as a source of instability in the Middle East, with the G7 leaders urging broader de-escalation of hostilities in the region.

The air war between Iran and Israel - which began on Friday when Israel attacked Iran with air strikes - has raised alarms in a region that had already been on edge since the start of Israel''s military assault on [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/) in October 2023.

"We affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel," G7 leaders said in the statement.

"Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror," the statement added and said the G7 was "clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon."

Israel attacked Iran on Friday in what it called a [preemptive](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-much-damage-have-israeli-strikes-caused-irans-nuclear-programme-2025-06-16/) strike to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Since then the two Middle Eastern rivals have exchanged blows, with Iranian officials reporting over 220 deaths, mostly civilians, while Israel said 24 civilians were killed.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and has said it has the right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, as a party to the Nuclear [Non-Proliferation Treaty](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-2025-06-16/).

Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East widely believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.

President Donald Trump planned to leave the G7 summit in Canada early to return to Washington due to the Middle East situation.

The United States has so far maintained that it is not involved in the Israeli attacks on Iran although Trump said on Friday the U.S. was aware of Israel''s strikes in advance and called them "excellent." Washington has warned Tehran not to attack U.S. interests or personnel in the region.

"We urge that the resolution of the Iranian crisis leads to a broader de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza," the G7 statement said, adding the nations were also ready to coordinate on safeguarding stability in energy markets.

An Israeli strike hit Iran''s state broadcaster on Monday while Trump said in a social media post that "everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran."

Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also discussed the Israel-Iran war in phone calls with his British, French and European Union counterparts on Monday.

Washington said Trump was [still aiming](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-chief-says-trump-still-aiming-deal-with-iran-2025-06-17/) for a nuclear deal with Iran.

JERUSALEM, June 18 (Reuters) - Israel''s [military assault on Iran](https://www.reuters.com/world/iran/) has united much of the nation after a period of bitter divisions over the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/), transforming the political landscape overnight as even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu''s foes close ranks behind him.

Most Israelis support [using force to destroy Iran''s nuclear programme](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/americas/israel-iran-air-war-enters-sixth-day-trump-calls-irans-unconditional-surrender-2025-06-17/), polling shows, despite retaliatory Iranian missile strikes that have killed 24 civilians and put [normal life on hold](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-resilience-tested-iranian-missile-strikes-hit-home-2025-06-16/).

"Netanyahu took a really difficult decision. On the topic of Iran, right now he is doing the right thing," Avigdor Lieberman, a legislator and hawkish former defence minister who fell out with Netanyahu and quit his government in 2018, told Reuters.

Netanyahu would ultimately be judged on whether Israel succeeded at removing [Iran''s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-much-damage-have-israeli-strikes-caused-irans-nuclear-programme-2025-06-16/), but for now things were going well, he said.

On a different section of the political spectrum, centrist former defence minister Benny Gantz, who walked out of Netanyahu''s war cabinet a year ago over disagreements about Gaza, was similarly supportive.

"On the Iranian issue, there is no right or left. There is right or wrong. And we are right," he told broadcaster CNN.

Israel says Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons that could hit its territory, which Tehran has always denied. In six days and nights of attacks, Israel has killed senior Iranian military leaders and damaged military and nuclear sites, as well as killing at least 224 civilians, according to an Iranian toll.

Iran''s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump''s demand for unconditional surrender and said Israel had made a "huge mistake" in starting the war.

## NORMAL POLITICS SUSPENDED

But in Israel, support for Netanyahu''s decision to attack was paying political dividends for him. The main opposition parties in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, on Monday voted against a motion of no confidence in the government.

Just a week ago, and only 24 hours before the first strikes on Iran, those same parties [voted for the Knesset to dissolve itself](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-knesset-set-vote-disbanding-first-step-possible-election-2025-06-11/), which had it succeeded would have been a first step towards early elections that polls suggest Netanyahu would lose.

"There are those who say Netanyahu chose this time to attack because of the political situation but that doesn''t interest me. I think this is the right decision," said Meirav Cohen, a member of the Knesset from the centrist Yesh Atid party, which leads the official opposition in the chamber.

Netanyahu''s political rivals and a large proportion of the public accuse him of prolonging the war in Gaza to stay in office and avoid a corruption trial, to the detriment of the hostages still held by Hamas and of Israel''s moral standing.

The Gaza war was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for the security failures that allowed it to happen.

Israel''s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza''s health ministry, while displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million and causing a hunger crisis.

Netanyahu has been unpopular throughout the war, and polls suggest he would not be able to put together a ruling coalition if elections were held now.

## GREAT SURVIVOR

But on Iran, 83% of Jewish Israelis support his decision to attack, according to a poll by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem conducted on Sunday and Monday.

"In contrast to the ongoing war in Gaza, which is perceived by many of us as a cynical move designed to serve political purposes, the Iranian story is far above any dispute," wrote columnist Ben Caspit, a fierce Netanyahu critic, in the newspaper Ma''ariv.

Netanyahu, often called the great survivor of Israeli politics after bouncing back from numerous crises and ruthlessly crushing a long list of adversaries, seems to be in an equally conciliatory mood.

Appearing on Tuesday night on Channel 14, a television station that strongly supports him, he was asked about longtime critics now lauding him over Iran.

"I don''t view it as personal. They are rising to the occasion. There really is such a thing. I wouldn''t be cynical about it," he said. "This is not a political matter. It is an existential matter."

However, the Hebrew University poll revealed a profound fault line between Israel''s Jewish majority and its Arab minority, who make up about 20% of the population. Only 12% of them support the assault on Iran.

Aida Touma-Suleiman, an Arab member of the Knesset from the left-wing Hadash party, told Reuters the Iran operation was aggressive and reckless.

"We think this is another disaster that is being inflicted on two people, the Iranian people and the Israeli people," she said.

- US preparations for Iran strikes more extensive than acknowledged
- Trump''s decision to back Israel came amid frustration with diplomatic process, pressure from political allies
- Israel planned Iran strikes with or without US support, officials say

WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Roughly one month ago, from the stage at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, U.S. President Donald Trump [issued a warning](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-calls-iran-most-destructive-force-vows-it-wont-get-nuclear-weapon-2025-05-13/) to Iran that would prove prophetic.

"We''ll never allow America and its allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack," Trump told the crowd, sending a message to the leadership in Tehran.

"The time is right now for them to choose. Right now. We don''t have a lot of time to wait. Things are happening at a very fast pace."

That May 13 ultimatum received little attention at the time.

But behind the scenes, the president already knew an attack on Iran could be imminent - and that there might be little he could do to stop it, according to two U.S. officials.

By mid-May, the Pentagon had begun drawing up detailed contingency plans to aid Israel if it followed through on its long-held ambition to strike Iran''s nuclear program, the officials said. And the U.S. had already diverted thousands of defensive weapons away from war-torn Ukraine toward the Middle East in preparation for potential conflict, according to a Western source familiar with the matter and a Ukrainian source.

The Pentagon declined to comment for this story.

This account of the weeks and days leading up to Trump''s decision to throw his support behind Israel''s bombing campaign is based on interviews with over a dozen administration officials, foreign diplomats and Trump confidantes, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

The picture that emerges is that of a long, secretive preparation process and a president who for weeks found himself torn between diplomacy and supporting military action - and was ultimately persuaded in part by an ally whose actions he did not fully control.

While Trump has long described himself as a peacemaker - [dispatching](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-aide-witkoff-travel-rome-iran-talks-2025-05-22/) Middle East envoy [Steve Witkoff](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-envoys-embrace-russian-demands-worries-republicans-us-allies-2025-04-11/) to the region several times to try to seal a diplomatic accord - he had several trusted political allies pushing him to back an Israeli attack on Iran''s nuclear facilities.

And U.S. intelligence had indicated a unilateral Israeli strike was possible, even likely, even if Trump wanted to wait, according to two U.S. officials.

While it is unclear if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Trump''s more hawkish allies ever got him to a "yes" to Israel''s plans, by the days leading up the strike he was at least not a "no," according to two senior U.S. officials and a senior Israeli source.

That stance, people familiar with the dynamics said, helped tip Israel into action.

Seven days into the Israel-Iran conflict, Trump is left with a dilemma, said Aaron David Miller, a veteran diplomat who has advised six secretaries of state on Middle East policy.

He can try again to pursue a diplomatic resolution with Iran, allow Iran and Israel "to fight it out," or he can enter the war with U.S. airstrikes on the deeply buried Fordow enrichment plant, a step that would have unknown consequences for the region.

Trump "let it (the Israeli attack) happen," said Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace policy institute. "He got on the tiger and he''s riding it."

The White House on Thursday said that Trump will make a decision on whether the U.S. will get involved in the conflict in the next two weeks.

The White House, the Israeli prime minister''s office and Iran''s delegation to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. Tehran has consistently said its nuclear program is designed for peaceful purposes only, a conclusion Washington has rejected.

## THE COMING STORM

One of the first hints that Trump might sign off on an Israeli bombing campaign came in April.

During a closed-door meeting on April 17, Saudi Arabia''s defense minister [delivered a blunt message](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-warned-iran-reach-nuclear-deal-with-trump-or-risk-israeli-strike-2025-05-30/) to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian: Take Trump''s offer to negotiate an agreement seriously because it presents a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel.

Reuters could not determine whether the message was sent at Washington''s behest, nor whether Iran''s leaders took that message seriously.

With hindsight, they should have.

The Israel Defense Forces and the head of U.S. Central Command, General Michael "Erik" Kurilla, were discussing detailed intelligence about Iran''s missile buildup and nuclear program and steps that could be required to defend U.S. troops and Israel itself in any conflict with Iran, according to a U.S. official and senior Israeli official.

Meanwhile, the U.S. was funneling weapons to Israel that would be useful for an air war with Iran. In one instance in early May, a large shipment of defensive missiles originally meant for Ukraine was diverted to Israel instead, according to the Western source and the Ukrainian source.

The diverted shipment caused consternation in Kyiv and sparked continued fears that additional weapons needed to defend against Moscow will instead be used to defend U.S. interests elsewhere, the Ukrainian source said.

In the opening months of Trump''s term, Israel had [already proposed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-still-eyeing-limited-attack-irans-nuclear-facilities-2025-04-19/) to Washington a series of options to attack Iran''s facilities, according to sources.

While Trump had rebuffed those ideas, saying he preferred diplomacy for the time being, several people close to him said he was never dead-set against using military force against Iran.

He had done so before. In 2020, despite a foreign policy during his first term that was otherwise marked by restraint, Trump [ordered a drone strike](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/irans-soleimani-and-iraqs-muhandis-killed-in-air-strike-militia-spokesman-idUSKBN1Z201C/) that killed major general Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards'' division responsible for its international operations.

The Iranian government has since sought to murder Trump in revenge, [U.S. prosecutors have said](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-iranian-man-plot-kill-donald-trump-justice-dept-says-2024-11-08/), an allegation Tehran denies.

Behind the scenes, Trump had been pulled in multiple directions on the Iran issue since before he even took office.

On one side, many supporters - including conservative media personality Tucker Carlson - and administration officials saw Trump''s Make America Great Again movement as an antidote to decades of foreign wars that cost thousands of American lives without significantly advancing American interests.

On the other, several close Trump allies - from conservative commentator Mark Levin to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - were portraying a nuclear Iran as an existential threat that must be removed at any cost.

Trump himself took pride in being a broker of peace.

"My proudest legacy," he said during his inauguration address, "will be that of a peacemaker and unifier."

## "IT''S A TANGO"

Ultimately, no U.S. official, Trump confidante or diplomat Reuters talked to identified an epiphany that tipped the scales for the president.

One senior administration official said that after months of sitting on the fence a lack of diplomatic progress, a push from the Israelis and appeals by hawkish allies likely wore him down.

Trump aides and allies have noted that Israel''s attack unfolded just after the expiry of a 60-day deadline the Trump administration had set for a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran.

The senior U.S. official said another dynamic was at play: As U.S. intelligence consistently showed Israel might go ahead with an attack with or without U.S. support, the administration could look caught off guard if they did not get behind it. Worse, it could appear that the U.S. was opposing a longtime ally.

Although Trump had appeared to some to snub Netanyahu as he pushed for a peaceful solution to the crisis, privately, Israel understood that Washington would stand by it, said a separate official.

By the time Trump talked to Netanyahu on Monday, June 9 - one of many phone calls in recent days - his stance was one of tacit, if not explicit approval, according to one U.S. and one Israeli official.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had said he would like more time to see diplomacy play out. But the U.S. official said that he did not explicitly veto Israel''s plans.

By Wednesday, June 11, it was clear to Washington that Israel''s plans were a go.

That day, Reuters reported that the U.S. was [preparing a partial evacuation](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-embassy-iraq-preparing-ordered-evacuation-due-heightened-security-risks-2025-06-11/) of its Iraqi embassy amid fears of reprisals from Iran following an imminent attack.

The next day, June 12, Washington [sent](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-gave-regional-allies-heads-up-israels-planned-attack-iran-2025-06-13/) a formal diplomatic note to several regional allies, warning them that an attack was imminent.

That evening, Israel [launched its overnight barrage](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/live-updates-israel-hits-iran-nuclear-facilities-missile-factories-2025-06-13/), an attack that almost immediately escalated into an air war.

Trump and some key cabinet members watched the events live from the wood-paneled "JFK room," part of the White House Situation Room. Other officials watched the events nearby.

On the menu, per one official: stone crabs from a local restaurant.

The initial attack appeared to be a success, with several close advisers to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei killed and key nuclear sites seriously damaged. Over the weekend, the Israelis [considered killing Khamenei himself](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-vetoed-an-israeli-plan-kill-irans-supreme-leader-us-officials-say-2025-06-15/), but were waved off by Trump, according to two U.S. officials.

Almost immediately, a political civil war erupted in Trump''s Republican Party, with several high-profile conservatives, including members of Congress, accusing his administration of fanning the flames of war.

Seven days on, the U.S. intelligence community believes the strikes have set Iran''s nuclear ambitions back by only months, according to a source familiar with U.S. intelligence reports, confirming a CNN report.

A significant blow to Iran''s nuclear ambitions, [most analysts say](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-much-damage-have-israeli-strikes-caused-irans-nuclear-programme-2025-06-16/), will require dropping bunker-busting bombs on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, the crown jewel of Iran''s nuclear program. Only the U.S. has that capability.

Trump has said he is considering such a strike, which would represent a major escalation for the United States.

As of Thursday, his intentions were [still unclear](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/americas/israel-iran-air-war-enters-sixth-day-trump-calls-irans-unconditional-surrender-2025-06-17/).

Iranian authorities have arrested more than 40 people, including truck drivers and supporters of a growing nationwide truckers’ strike, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA).

Nine people were arrested on Sunday as Iran''s nationwide truckers’ strike reached its 11th consecutive day, spreading to at least 155 cities despite a mounting government crackdown.

Iran’s attempt to quell a growing nationwide trucker strike has stumbled against the sheer scale and ownership structure of the sector, as more than 400,000 privately owned heavy vehicles remain off the roads despite pressure from authorities since the walkout began on May 22.

A growing nationwide strike by Iranian truckers could cripple the economy and spark a broader civil movement, experts said on Eye for Iran, calling it the most serious challenge the government has faced in recent years.

At least 20 people have been arrested across Iran since truck drivers launched a nationwide strike on May 22, with political prisoners in Tehran’s Evin Prison voicing support on the protest’s ninth day.

The truckers’ strike is one of Iran’s largest labor protests in recent years—halting freight, disrupting supply chains, and exposing deeper undercurrents of discontent in a nation already under economic strain.

- Netanyahu hopes success will secure his legacy

JERUSALEM, June 13 (Reuters) - Iran once ridiculed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the boy who cried wolf for his constant public warnings about Tehran''s nuclear programme, and his repeated threats to shut it down, one way or another.

"You can only fool some of the people so many times," Iran''s then-foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in 2018 after Netanyahu had once again accused Iran of planning to build nuclear weapons.

On Friday, after two decades of continually raising the alarm and urging other world leaders to act, Netanyahu finally decided to go it alone, authorising an [Israeli air assault](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-it-strikes-iran-amid-nuclear-tensions-2025-06-13/) aimed, Israel says, at preventing Iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.

In an address to the nation, Netanyahu, as he has so often before, evoked the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two to explain his decision.

"Nearly a century ago, facing the Nazis, a generation of leaders failed to act in time," Netanyahu said, adding that a policy of appeasing Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler had led to the deaths of 6 million Jews, "a third of my people".

"After that war, the Jewish people and the Jewish state vowed never again. Well, never again is now today. Israel has shown that we have learned the lessons of history."

Iran says its nuclear energy programme is only for peaceful purposes, although the International Atomic Energy Agency on Thursday declared the country in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years.

Netanyahu, a former member of an elite special forces unit responsible for some of Israel’s most daring hostage rescues, has dominated its politics for decades, becoming the longest-serving prime minister when he won an unprecedented sixth term in 2022.

Throughout his years in office, he rarely missed an opportunity to lecture foreign leaders about the dangers posed by Iran, displaying cartoons of an atomic bomb at the United Nations, while always hinting he was ready to strike.

In past premierships, military analysts said his room for manoeuvre with Iran was limited by fears an attack would trigger instant retaliation from Tehran''s regional proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, that would be hard to contain.

But the past two years have upended the Middle East, with [Israel hammering Hamas](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/) after it launched a massive surprise attack of its own against Israel in October 2023, and then dismantling much of Hezbollah in just a few days in 2024.

## BLINDSIDED BY TRUMP

Israel has also sparred openly with Tehran since 2024, firing rocket salvos deep into Iran last year that gave Netanyahu confidence in the power of his military reach.

Israeli military sources said the strikes disabled four of Iran''s Russian-made air-defence systems, including one positioned near Natanz, a key [Iranian nuclear site](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-main-nuclear-facilities-long-israels-sights-2024-10-02/) that was targeted, according to Iranian television.

"Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities. We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal — to thwart and eliminate the existential threat," Defence Minister Israel Katz said in November.

But much to the consternation of Netanyahu, newly installed U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) blindsided him during a visit to the White House in April, when he announced the United States and Iran were poised to begin direct nuclear talks.

Netanyahu has locked horns with successive U.S. presidents over Iran, most noticeably Barack Obama, who approved a deal with Tehran in 2015 imposing significant restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Trump pulled out of the accord in 2018, and Netanyahu had hoped that he would continue to take an uncompromising stance against Iran when he returned to office this year.

In announcing talks, the White House set a two-month deadline for Iran to sign a deal. Even though a fresh round of meetings was set for this weekend, the unofficial deadline expired on Thursday and Netanyahu pounced.

One Israeli official told state broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington ahead of the attacks and suggested recent newspaper reports of a rift between Trump and Netanyahu over Iran had been a ruse to lull the Tehran leadership into a false sense of security.

## IMAGE TARNISHED

Trump - who said after the strikes began that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb but that he wants talks to proceed - has previously hailed the right-wing Netanyahu as a great friend. Other leaders have struggled with him.

In 2011, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was overheard talking about Netanyahu with Obama. "I can''t stand him any more, he''s a liar," he said.

The man once known as "King Bibi" to his supporters has faced a difficult few years and at 75, time is running out for him to secure his legacy.

His hawkish image was badly tarnished by the 2023 Hamas attack, with polls showing most Israelis blaming him for the security failures that allowed the deadliest assault since the founding of the nation more than 75 years ago.

He has subsequently been indicted by the International Criminal Court over possible war crimes tied to Israel''s 20-month invasion of Gaza, which has reduced much of the Palestinian territory to rubble. He rejects the charges against him.

Polls show most Israelis believe the war in Gaza has gone on for too long, with Netanyahu dragging out the conflict to stay in power and stave off elections that pollsters say he will lose.

Even as the multi-front war has progressed, he has had to take the stand in his own, long-running corruption trial, where he denies any wrongdoing, which has further dented his reputation at home.

However, he hopes a successful military campaign against Israel''s arch foe will secure his place in the history books he so loves to read.

"Generations from now, history will record that our generation stood its ground, acted in time and secured our common future. May God bless Israel. May God bless the forces of civilisation, everywhere," he said in Friday''s speech.

WASHINGTON/DUBAI/JERUSALEM, June 18 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump kept the world guessing about whether the United States will join Israel''s bombardment of Iranian nuclear sites as the Israel-Iran conflict entered its seventh day on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump declined to say if he had made any decision on whether to join Israel''s [campaign](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-iran-conflict-live-trump-leaves-g7-summit-early-says-should-evacuate-2025-06-17/). "I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I''m going to do," he said.

Trump in later remarks said Iranian officials wanted to come to Washington for a meeting and that "we may do that." But he added, "It''s a little late" for such talks.

The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain plan to hold [nuclear talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/european-ministers-hold-nuclear-talks-with-iran-friday-geneva-source-says-2025-06-18/) with their Iranian counterpart on Friday in Geneva aimed at persuading Iran to firmly guarantee that it will use its [nuclear program](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-iran-conflict-live-trump-leaves-g7-summit-early-says-should-evacuate-2025-06-17/) solely for civilian purposes, a German diplomatic source told Reuters.

But while diplomatic efforts continue, some residents of Tehran, a city of 10 million people, on Wednesday jammed highways out of the city as they sought sanctuary from [intensified Israeli airstrikes](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-iran-conflict-live-trump-leaves-g7-summit-early-says-should-evacuate-2025-06-17/).

The Wall Street Journal said Trump had told senior aides he approved attack plans on Iran but was holding off on giving the final order to see if Tehran would abandon its nuclear program.

Asked if he thought the Iranian government could fall as a result of the Israeli campaign, Trump said: "Sure, anything could happen."

Referring to the destruction or dismantling of Iran''s Fordow nuclear enrichment center, Trump said: "We''re the only ones that have the capability to do it. But that doesn''t mean I''m going to do it - at all."

Military analysts believe that Israel might need U.S. military help to destroy Fordow, dug beneath a mountain near the city of Qom.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali [Khamenei](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-supreme-leader-khamenei-has-been-implacable-opponent-us-israel-2025-06-17/), 86, rebuked Trump in a recorded speech played on television, his first appearance since Friday.

The Americans "should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage," he said. "The Iranian nation will not surrender."

In its latest bombings, Israel said its air force destroyed Iran''s police headquarters.

Israel''s military said sirens sounded in northern Israel just before 2 a.m. local time on Thursday (23:00 GMT on Wednesday) and that it had intercepted a drone launched from Iran. It said several minutes later that another drone was intercepted in the Jordan Valley area.

The Iranian missile salvoes mark the first time in decades of shadow war and proxy conflict that a significant number of projectiles fired from Iran have penetrated defences, killing Israelis in their homes.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a video released by his office on Wednesday, said Israel was "progressing step by step" towards eliminating threats posed by Iran''s nuclear sites and ballistic missile arsenal.

"We are hitting the nuclear sites, the missiles, the headquarters, the symbols of the regime," Netanyahu said.

Israel, which is not a party to the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.

Netanyahu also thanked Trump, "a great friend of the state of Israel", for standing by its side in the conflict, saying the two were in continuous contact.

Trump has veered from proposing a swift diplomatic end to the war to suggesting the United States might join it.

In social media posts on Tuesday, he mused about killing Khamenei.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, asked what his reaction would be if [Israel did kill Iran''s Supreme Leader](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-iran-germanys-merz-2025-06-18/) with the assistance of the United States, said on Thursday: "I do not even want to discuss this possibility. I do not want to."

A source familiar with internal discussions said Trump and his team were considering options that included joining Israel in strikes against Iranian [nuclear installations](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-much-damage-have-israeli-strikes-caused-irans-nuclear-programme-2025-06-16/).

Iran''s mission to the United Nations mocked Trump in posts on X, describing him as "a has-been warmonger clinging to relevance."

Israel''s military said scores of Israeli jets had struck targets in and around Tehran and in western Iran in the previous 24 hours in three waves, hitting sites producing raw materials, components and manufacturing systems for missiles.

## FLEEING TEHRAN

Arezou, a 31-year-old Tehran resident, told Reuters by phone that she had made it out of the city to the nearby resort town of Lavasan.

"My friend’s house in Tehran was attacked and her brother was injured. They are civilians," she said. "Why are we paying the price for the regime’s decision to pursue a nuclear programme?”

In Israel, sirens rang out anew at dusk on Wednesday warning of further incoming Iranian missiles. A motorist was injured by missile debris, Israeli medics said. The army later advised civilians they could leave protected areas, signalling the threat had passed.

At Ramat Gan train station east of Tel Aviv, people were lying on city-supplied mattresses or sitting in the odd camping chair, with plastic water bottles strewn about.

"I feel scared, overwhelmed. Especially because I live in a densely populated area that Iran seems to be targeting, and our city has very old buildings, without shelters and safe spaces," said Tamar Weiss, clutching her four-month-old daughter.

Iran has reported at least 224 deaths in Israeli attacks, mostly civilians, but has not updated that toll for days.

Since Friday, Iran has fired around 400 missiles at Israel, some 40 of which have pierced air defences, killing 24 people, all of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.

## LEVERAGE

Iran has been exploring options for leverage, including veiled threats to hit the global oil market by restricting access to the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, the world''s most important shipping artery for oil.

Inside Iran, authorities are intent on preventing panic and shortages. Fewer images of destruction have been allowed to circulate than in the early days of the bombing, when state media showed pictures of explosions, fires and flattened apartments. A ban on filming by the public has been imposed.

The communications ministry said on Wednesday that temporary restrictions on internet access would be imposed to help prevent "the enemy from threatening citizens'' lives and property".

Iran''s ability to hit back hard at Israel through strikes by proxy militia close to Israeli borders has been limited by the devastating blows Israel has dealt to Tehran''s regional allies - Hamas and Hezbollah - in conflicts in [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/) and Lebanon since 2023.

- Summary

- Investors fear U.S. involvement in Israel-Iran conflict could affect stock markets
- Oil prices may rise sharply if U.S. attacks Iran, impacting global economy
- Dollar gains as investors seek safe haven

June 18 (Reuters) - Financial markets may be in for a "knee-jerk" selloff if the U.S. military attacks Iran, with economists warning that a dramatic rise in oil prices could damage a global economy already strained by President Donald Trump''s tariffs.

Oil prices fell nearly 2% on Wednesday as investors weighed the chance of supply disruptions from the and potential direct U.S. involvement. The price of crude remains up almost 9% since Israel launched attacks against Iran last Friday in a bid to cripple its ability to produce nuclear weapons.

With major U.S. stock indexes trading near record highs despite uncertainty about Trump''s trade policy, some investors worry that equities may be particularly vulnerable to sources of additional global uncertainty.

Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services, said U.S. stocks might initially sell off should Trump order the U.S. military to become more heavily involved in the Israel-Iran conflict, but that a faster escalation might also bring the situation to an end sooner.
"I could see the initial knee-jerk would be, ''this is bad''," Carlson said. "I think it will bring things to a head quicker."

Wednesday''s dip in crude, along with a modest 0.3% increase in the S&P 500, [(.SPX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SPX) came after Trump reporters'' questions about whether the U.S. was planning to strike Iran but said Iran had proposed to come for talks at the White House. Adding to uncertainty, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected Trump''s demand for unconditional surrender.

U.S. Treasury yields fell as concerns over the war in Iran boosted safe haven demand for the debt.

The U.S. military is also bolstering its presence in the region, [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-moving-fighter-jets-middle-east-israel-iran-war-rages-2025-06-17/), further stirring speculation about U.S. intervention that investors fear could widen the conflict in an area with critical energy resources, supply chains and infrastructure.

With investors viewing the dollar as a safe haven, it has gained around 1% against both the Japanese yen and Swiss franc since last Thursday. On Wednesday, the U.S. currency took a breather, edging fractionally lower against the yen and the franc.

“I don''t think personally that we are going to join this war. I think Trump is going to do everything possible to avoid it. But if it can''t be avoided, then initially that''s going to be negative for the markets,” said Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "Gold would shoot up. Yields would probably come down lower and the dollar would probably rally."

Barclays warned that crude prices could rise to $85 per barrel if Iranian exports are reduced by half, and that prices could rise about $100 in the "worst case" scenario of a wider conflagration. Brent crude was last at about $76.

Citigroup economists warned in a note on Wednesday that materially higher oil prices "would be a negative supply shock for the global economy, lowering growth and boosting inflation—creating further challenges for central banks that are already trying to navigate the risks from tariffs."

![US military action against Iran before July?](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/IRAN-NUCLEAR/MARKETS/zgpozwkxdvd/chart.png)

US military action against Iran before July?

Trump taking a "heavier hand" would not be a surprise to the market, mitigating any negative asset price reaction, Carlson said, while adding that he was still not convinced that the U.S. would take a heavier role.

Trades on the Polymarket betting website point to a 63% expectation of "U.S. military action against Iran before July", down from as much as an 82% likelihood on Tuesday, but still above a 35% chance before the conflict began last Friday.

The S&P 500 energy sector index [(.SPNY), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SPNY) has rallied over 2% in the past four sessions, lifted by a 3.8% gain in Exxon Mobil and 5% rally in Valero Energy. That compares to a 0.7% drop in the S&P 500 over the same period, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of higher oil prices on the economy, and about growing global uncertainty generated by the conflict.

Turmoil in the Middle East comes as investors are already fretting about the effect of Trump''s tariffs on the global economy.

The World Bank last week slashed its [global growth forecast](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/world-bank-slashes-global-growth-forecast-trade-tensions-bite-2025-06-10/) for 2025 by four-tenths of a percentage point to 2.3%, saying that higher tariffs and heightened uncertainty posed a "significant headwind" for nearly all economies.

Defense stocks, already lifted by Russia''s conflict with Ukraine, have made modest gains since Israel launched its attacks. The S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense index [(.SPLRCAED), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SPLRCAED) hit record highs early last week in the culmination of a rebound of over 30% from losses in the wake of Trump''s April 2 "Liberation Day" tariff announcements.

Even after the latest geopolitical uncertainty, the S&P 500 remains just 2% below its February record high close.

"Investors want to be able to look past this, and until we see reasons to believe that this is going to be a much larger regional conflict with the U.S. perhaps getting involved and a high chance of escalating, you''re going to see the market want to shrug this off as much as it can,” Osman Ali, global co-head of Quantitative Investment Strategies, said at an investor conference on Wednesday.

Netanyahu''s political rivals and a large proportion of the public accuse him of prolonging the war in Gaza to stay in office and avoid a corruption trial, to the detriment of the hostages still held by Hamas and of Israel''s moral standing. The Gaza war was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for the security failures that allowed it to happen. Israel''s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza''s health ministry, while displacing nearly the entire population of 2.3 million and causing a hunger crisis.

By the time Trump talked to Netanyahu on Monday, June 9 - one of many phone calls in recent days - his stance was one of tacit, if not explicit approval, according to one U.S. and one Israeli official. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had said he would like more time to see diplomacy play out. But the U.S. official said that he did not explicitly veto Israel''s plans. By Wednesday, June 11, it was clear to Washington that Israel''s plans were a go. That day, Reuters reported that the U.S. was [preparing a partial evacuation](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-embassy-iraq-preparing-ordered-evacuation-due-heightened-security-risks-2025-06-11/) of its Iraqi embassy amid fears of reprisals from Iran following an imminent attack.

Title: Iran Requests UNESCO''s Urgent Intervention to Safeguard Heritage

Description: Iran has formally requested UNESCO’s urgent intervention to safeguard its cultural and natural heritage from military threats linked to Israeli attacks.

Iran has formally requested UNESCO’s urgent intervention to safeguard its cultural and natural heritage from military threats linked to Israeli attacks.

In an official letter to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay, Iran highlighted its stewardship of over 40,000 nationally registered sites and 28 World Heritage nominations, including 54 historic caravanserais, the national railway, Hyrcanian forests, qanats, and historic gardens.

The Iranian missile salvoes mark the first time in decades of shadow war and proxy conflict that a significant number of projectiles fired from Iran have penetrated defences, killing Israelis in their homes.

The S&P 500 energy sector index [(.SPNY), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/quote/.SPNY) has rallied over 2% in the past four sessions, lifted by a 3.8% gain in Exxon Mobil and 5% rally in Valero Energy.
